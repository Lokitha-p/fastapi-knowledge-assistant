First Steps - FastAPI Skip to content First Steps ¶ The simplest FastAPI file could look like this: Python 3.9+ from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI () @app . get ( "/" ) async def root (): return { "message" : "Hello World" } Copy that to a file main.py .

 quit) That line shows the URL where your app is being served, in your local machine. Check it ¶ Open your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000 . You will see the JSON response as: { "message" : "Hello World" } Interactive API docs ¶ Now go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs . You will see the automatic interactive API documentation (provided by Swagger UI ): Alternative API docs ¶ And now, go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc . You will see the alternative automatic documentation (provided by ReDoc ): OpenAPI ¶ FastAPI generates a "schema" with all your API using the OpenAPI standard for defining APIs. "Schema" ¶ A "schema" is a definition or description of something. Not the code that implements it, but just an abstract description. API "schema" ¶ In this case, OpenAPI is a specification that dictates how to define a schema of your API. This schema definition includes your API paths, the possible parameters they take, etc. Data "schema" ¶ The term "schema" might also refer to the shape of some d

ata, like a JSON content. In that case, it would mean the JSON attributes, and data types they have, etc. OpenAPI and JSON Schema ¶ OpenAPI defines an API schema for your API. And that schema includes definitions (or "schemas") of the data sent and received by your API using JSON Schema , the standard for JSON data schemas. Check the openapi.json ¶ If you are curious about how the raw OpenAPI schema looks like, FastAPI automatically generates a JSON (schema) with the descriptions of all your API. You can see it directly at: http://127.0.0.1:8000/openapi.json . It will show a JSON starting with something like: { "openapi" : "3.1.0" , "info" : { "title" : "FastAPI" , "version" : "0.1.0" }, "paths" : { "/items/" : { "get" : { "responses" : { "200" : { "description" : "Successful Response" , "content" : { "application/json" : { ... What is OpenAPI for ¶ The OpenAPI schema is what powers the two interactive documentation systems included. And there are dozens of alternatives, all based on O

penAPI. You could easily add any of those alternatives to your application built with FastAPI . You could also use it to generate code automatically, for clients that communicate with your API. For example, frontend, mobile or IoT applications. Deploy your app (optional) ¶ You can optionally deploy your FastAPI app to FastAPI Cloud , go and join the waiting list if you haven't. 🚀 If you already have a FastAPI Cloud account (we invited you from the waiting list 😉), you can deploy your application with one command. Before deploying, make sure you are logged in: $ fastapi login You are logged in to FastAPI Cloud 🚀 Then deploy your app: $ fastapi deploy Deploying to FastAPI Cloud... ✅ Deployment successful! 🐔 Ready the chicken! Your app is ready at https://myapp.fastapicloud.dev That's it! Now you can access your app at that URL. ✨ Recap, step by step ¶ Step 1: import FastAPI ¶ Python 3.9+ from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI () @app . get ( "/" ) async def root (): return { "message"

 : "Hello World" } FastAPI is a Python class that provides all the functionality for your API. Technical Details FastAPI is a class that inherits directly from Starlette . You can use all the Starlette functionality with FastAPI too. Step 2: create a FastAPI "instance" ¶ Python 3.9+ from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI () @app . get ( "/" ) async def root (): return { "message" : "Hello World" } Here the app variable will be an "instance" of the class FastAPI . This will be the main point of interaction to create all your API. Step 3: create a path operation ¶ Path ¶ "Path" here refers to the last part of the URL starting from the first / . So, in a URL like: https://example.com/items/foo ...the path would be: /items/foo Info A "path" is also commonly called an "endpoint" or a "route". While building an API, the "path" is the main way to separate "concerns" and "resources". Operation ¶ "Operation" here refers to one of the HTTP "methods". One of: POST GET PUT DELETE ...and the mor

e exotic ones: OPTIONS HEAD PATCH TRACE In the HTTP protocol, you can communicate to each path using one (or more) of these "methods". When building APIs, you normally use these specific HTTP methods to perform a specific action. Normally you use: POST : to create data. GET : to read data. PUT : to update data. DELETE : to delete data. So, in OpenAPI, each of the HTTP methods is called an "operation". We are going to call them " operations " too. Define a path operation decorator ¶ Python 3.9+ from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI () @app . get ( "/" ) async def root (): return { "message" : "Hello World" } The @app.get("/") tells FastAPI that the function right below is in charge of handling requests that go to: the path / using a get operation @decorator Info That @something syntax in Python is called a "decorator". You put it on top of a function. Like a pretty decorative hat (I guess that's where the term came from). A "decorator" takes the function below and does something wit
